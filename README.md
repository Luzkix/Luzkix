#**Hello everyone, this is mine main Green Fox repository with various homeworks as i learned Java during Foundation and Orientation phases:**

https://github.com/Luzkix/Luzkix - the repo contains week by week homeworks as i progressed throw the first 2 modules of Green Fox Academy Junior Developer Course 

#**In Project phase it was all about teamwork and buildig a "big" Spring RESTful application, with many endpoints, a lot of logic and implementations of new technologies, and of course testing...a lot of testing...:**

https://github.com/Luzkix/alcool-tribes-backend - the app is a result of 3-4 months of work of 4 developers (including me). There was like 40-50 user stories to be implemented, often overlaping so we could also learn from others. We worked in 2-week sprints. We used git branches, did mutual code reviews, trying to simulate work as if we worked in company. 

The app itself is a backend RESTful app simulating a very basic RPG game, which have players, kingdoms, various buildings(townhall, farm, mine, academy), troops, resources (gold, food), etc. We implemented Spring Security based on bearer token authentication (JWT tokens), database versioning based on Flyway, players need to verify their email address, events on all endpoints are automatically logged into console using Interceptors, playerÂ´s avatar (picture - MultipartFile) can be uploaded to/downloaded from predefined project folder, resources are automatically updated based on the last update time, 2 kingdoms can battle each other, factories were used for creation of testing objects, etc.

#**Note: Before I started with the full course I participated on a month lenght Green Fox coding camp which focused on html and basics of JavaSript :**
